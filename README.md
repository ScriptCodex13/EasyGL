# EasyGL

We all have not enough time to learn everything. I tought when I started to learn OpenGL. OpenGL is easy if you look at other graphic APIs out there, but for some of us like me it was not easy enough. It was still very time consuming to learn OpenGl and I still have to learn a lot. So I thought it would be better to get a solution for this problem. This project should be a simplification of The OpenGL-GLFW-Core-Profile. It is easier to learn and to use. You can use it for example to try something out or want to start a short Project with a very short time limit. 

I hope this repo helps you to build your project easier.
